# code2
There is a (now private) /code repository that had the pull requests and commits for these files. I had to delete a file using filter-repo and my initial attempts broke everything. I ended up with 2 main repositories locally, one of which apparently was not published, and the other gave me an error when trying to access it. I also ended with the branch I made for the c program having a completely different commit history from main.
